# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project is built to predict passenger survival on the Titanic using Machine Learning techniques.
Unlike a typical tutorial-based implementation, this project was done with the intention of strengthening my practical understanding of data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model building workflows.
The primary focus of this project was to gain strong hands-on experience with real-world data handling and to improve my grip on essential Data Science tools and concepts.
